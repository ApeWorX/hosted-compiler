It is an off-chain log interpretation issue.\n                 The main reason why we do not disallow address poisonig is that\n                 we do not want to potentially break any DeFi composability.\n                 This issue has been extensively discussed here:\n                 https://github.com/pcaversaccio/snekmate/issues/51,\n                 as well as in the OpenZeppelin repository:\n                 https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/issues/3931.\n\"\"\"\n\n\n# @dev We import and implement the `ERC20` interface,\n# which is a built-in interface of the Vyper compiler.\nfrom vyper.interfaces import ERC20\nimplements: ERC20\n\n\n# @dev We import and implement the `ERC20Detailed` interface,\n# which is a built-in interface of the Vyper compiler.\nfrom vyper.interfaces import ERC20Detailed\nimplements: ERC20Detailed\n\n\n# @dev We import and implement the `IERC20Permit`\n# interface, which is written using standard Vyper\n# syntax.\nimport interfaces.IERC20Permit as IERC20Permit\nimplements: IERC20Permit\n\n\n# @dev We import and implement the `IERC5267` interface,\n# which is written using standard Vyper syntax.\nfrom ..utils.interfaces import IERC5267\nimplements: IERC5267\n\n\n# @dev Returns the decimals places of the token.\n# The default value is 18.\n# @notice If you declare a variable as `public`,\n# Vyper automatically generates an `external`\n# getter function for the variable.
